# image_public (ascii art)
1. download the image_public.py script
2. drop your image in the same directory as the script and rename the image to "img.png" (must be png)
3. run the script, then adjust the terminal size until the image is visible.

> a terminal size of 120 will get 1 image, 240 will get 2 images, etc.  
> works best on black and white images or high contrast images.  
> writes to a file named 'picture.txt', also writes to stdout.
